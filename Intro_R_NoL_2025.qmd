## Goal

**Overarching goal**: to develop a general and basic introduction to R programming--In other words, the goal of this module is to present basic aspects for anyone to be free of initial fear and start using [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org) to perform data analysis.

::: callout-note
Every learning process becomes more effective when theory is combined with practice; in this sense, I strongly recommend that you follow the exercises in this module at the same time that you run the commands on your computer and not just read them passively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Software

-   R ([Version 4.4+](https://cran.r-project.org)) and RStudio ([Version](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)2025.05)

::: incremental
-   R is the programming language (AKA the engine)
    -   Comes with its own GUI on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but it's not great!
-   RStudio is software to help you efficiently write R code (AKA the dahsboard)
    -   Called an **integrated development environment** (IDE)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why R?

::: incremental
R is a language and a statistical programming environment and graphics or also called an **"object-oriented programming"**.

-   This means that when using **R** you are creating and manipulating objects on your screen. Simply put, you are telling your computer to perform a specific task rather than simply press a button **(black box paradox)**.
:::

::: callout-note
The main advantage of **R** is that the user has control over what is happening and also has a full understanding of what they want before performing any analysis.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why R?

::: incremental
-   With R, it is possible to manipulate and analyze data, make graphics and write from small commands to entire programs.

-   R is the open version of the S language, created by Bell's Lab in 1980. Interestingly, the S language is super popular among different areas of science and is the base for commercial products such as SPSS, STATA, and SAS, among others. Thus, if we have to add another advantage to R, is that R is an **open language and free**!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why R?

::: incremental
-   R has a very large community, so there are tons of packages and it's easy to find help.

-   R is a programming language, so you can do almost anything you want with it (you don't have to rely on whatever is implemented in the software you use).

-   R can handle almost any data format.

-   R makes it easy to create reproducible analysis.

-   Find a job! R skills transfer well to other programming languages, and many stats-related jobs require proficiency in R.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cite R

::: callout-note
When we are reporting our results in the form of a report, scientific paper, or any kind of document, we need to cite the software used. The easiest way to get the proper reference to cite **R** is by using the internal function **citation()**.
:::

```{r}
citation()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What about RStudio?

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R. With RStudio you can:

::: incremental
-   Organize your code, output, plots, and objects.
-   View and explore data and objects.
-   Interact with git and github.
-   Write and edit other languages--e.g., python, C++, and more!

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

In RStudio choose *File \> New File \> R Script*.

Then, let's get oriented with the interface:

-   *Top left*: Code **editor** panel (R script), data viewer (browse with tabs)

-   *Top right*: **Console** for running code (`>` prompt)

-   *Bottom left*: List of objects in **environment**, code **history** tab.

-   *Bottom right*: Browsing files, viewing plots, managing packages, and viewing help files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running code

There are different ways to run your code:

-   Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run*

-   Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>

::: callout-tip
To run a specific line of code, you just need to place the cursor on a line you want to run and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Working directory

First of all, we need to know **WHERE** are we working at. In other words, our working directory. To get information that information we just need to type **getwd()** in the script or the console.

```{r}

getwd()

```

If the working directory is not the correct one, we just need to order R to **SET** the correct address. To do that we use function **setwd()**

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
setwd("Your path or directory")

```

::: callout-tip
When using the **setwd()** function, we need to use quotation marks to specify the correct address. For example: **setwd("Dropbox/Teaching/NOL_Itasca/NoL-2025")**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Working directory structure

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
For training purposes, we will create a **working directory structure** where the main folder is our current working environment, so we will create a series of **subfolders** where we store, the data, the scripts and whatever we want... To do that we will use the function **dir.create()**. Let's practice!
:::

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

dir.create("Intro_R") # this folder will be your main folder.

dir.create("Intro_R/data") # folder that store the data 

dir.create("Intro_R/r_scripts") # folder that store the scripts used in the course

dir.create("Intro_R/figures") # folder that store the figures created in the course

dir.create("Intro_R/results") # The results

dir.create("Intro_R/Temp") 
```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
Every time you use R you will need to check your working directory to avoid errors.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functions and the question mark "?" or the help function

Maybe, the most important (at least for Jesús) function of R is **help** or **?**. Using help or the question mark, we can ask to R about almost anything (sadly we can't order pizza, yet)... so, let's practice!

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

help("logarithm")

?log

??log

```

::: callout-tip
Other important and useful functions in R are: **head()**, **tail()**, **dim()**, **str()**, **summary()**, **names()**, **class()**, **rm()**, **save()**, **saveRDS(), readRDS()**, **load()**, **source()**, all these simple functions will help us to understand our data.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R as calculator

Write the following in the Console and the hit ENTER

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
 
1 + 2

```

Repeat the process but in the R script. Can you explain the difference?

::: callout-tip
Remember that when you run a line of code using Scripts, you should hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R as calculator

Try more operations

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
 
number - number

number * number

number / number

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R as calculator

You can also perform chain operations

::: incremental
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
 
5 + 4 - 3 + 2
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

4 * 5 + 3 * 7^2

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

10 * (2 + 3) / 2

```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variables/Objects

When you are performing data analyses you need to store **variables** in the computer memory. for In **R** you can create and manipulate different kind of data, from a simple numeric vector to complex spatial and/or phylogenetic DataFrames. The main six kinds of objects that you can create and manipulate in R, are:

-   Vectors (numeric, character, factor, logic)

-   Matrices

-   DataFrames

-   Lists

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objects: Vectors

Let's start with Vectors. Vectors are the basic object in R and basically, contains elements of the same type (e.g., numbers, characters). Within vector exist four types: numeric, character, factor, and logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors: numeric vectors

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- 10 # numeric value 

b <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # numeric vector

class(b) # ask to R which type of object is b

seq_test <- seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 2) # Here is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20, every two numbers

seq_test_v2 <- c(1:10) # Create a sequence of 1 to 10. What is the difference with the "seq_test" vector? 

sample(seq_test, 2, replace = TRUE) # Sort two numbers within the object seq_test

rep(1:2, c(10, 3)) # Repeat the number one, ten times and the number 2 three times

aa <- length(seq_test_v2) # What we are doing in here?

str(seq_test) # Look at the structure of the data

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors: character vectors

We can also create vector of characters, which mean that instead of storing numbers we can store characters.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

cbs_departments <- c("EEB", "PMB", "BTL", "GCBD", "BMBB")

cbs_departments

```

Explore the character vector using the function **str()**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| 

str(cbs_departments) 


```

::: callout-note
Create a different character vector, for example, using the names of your peers.
:::

::: callout-tip
# The function concatenate or simply c()

Combine multiple elements to form a vector.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors: logic vectors

This kind of vector is super useful when the purpose is to create or build functions. The elements of a logic vector are **TRUE, FALSE, NA** (not available).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

is.factor(seq_test) # Is it a factor? (FALSE)

is.matrix(seq_test) # Is it a matrix? (FALSE)

is.vector(seq_test) # Is it a vector? (TRUE)

is.numeric(seq_test) # Is it a numeric vector? (TRUE)

a < 1   # 'a' is lower than 1? (FALSE)

a == 1   # 'a' is equal to 1? (TRUE)

a >= 1   # 'a' is higher or equal to 1? (TRUE)

a != 2   # the object 'a' is different of two? (TRUE) (!= negation)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors: factor vectors

A factor is useful to create categorical variables, that is very common in statistical analyses, such as the Anova.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

dt_f <- factor(c("small", "medium", "large"))

is.factor(dt_f) # Check if the object is correct.

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Matrix

A matrix is bidimensional arrangement of **vectors**, where the vectors need to be of the same type, that is, two or more numeric vectors, or two or more character vectors.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

matx <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 20)
rownames(matx) <-  LETTERS[1:20] # names of the rows
colnames(matx) <- c("Sample01", "Sample02", "Sample03", 
                    "Sample04", "Sample05") # names of the columns or headers

## Inspect the matrix
matx

class(matx) # Ask, which kind of data is?

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Matrix - getting access to the data

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

head(matx) # first rows of your data

tail(matx) # last rows of your data

matx[, 1] # We can use brackets to select a specific column

matx[1, ] # We can use brackets to select a specific row 

str(matx) # structure of the matrix

summary(matx) # summary statistics of the data in the matrix

```

::: callout-tip
In general, when we are exploring our data for example using **head()** the function will return only the 6 first rows of our matrix, however, we can add another argument into the function. For example, **head(matx, 10)**, just add the number 10 after the comma and is possible to see the first 10 lines. This simple operation is useful specially when our matrix is large **\>100 rows**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DataFrames

The difference between a matrix and a dataframe is that a dataframe can handle different types of vectors. You can explore more about the dataframes asking R **?data.frame**. Let's create a data frame and explore its properties.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

df <- data.frame(species = c("spp_1", "spp_2", "spp_3", "spp4"), # Character vector
                 habitat = factor(c("hab_1", "hab_2", "hab_3", "hab_4")), # Factor vector
                 high = c(10, 2, 7, 4), # numeric vector
                 distance = c(3, 9, 5, 6))

class(df)

```

::: callout-tip
In addition to the functions used to explore the data in the matrices, in dataframes we can also use the **`$`** symbol to access to a specific column. For example, type in your console **df\$habitat**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lists

The list is an object that consists of an assembly of objects sorted in a hierarchical way. Here we will use the data previously created.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

lst <- list(dt_f, df, matx)

```

We can now go ahead and inspect the list.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

str(lst)

```

And also check if the object created is, in fact, a list.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

class(lst)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lists

Now, inspect the objects that are stored into our object **lst**. To do this, we just need to use two brackets **\[\[\]\]**.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

lst[[1]]

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

lst[[2]]

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
lst[[3]]

```

::: callout-note
At to this point, we have explored the most common objects in R. Understanding the structure of each class of objects (from vectors to lists) is maybe the most critical step to learning R.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lists

::: callout-tip
We can also name each object of the a list and get access to a specific object by using the **`$`** symbol.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

names(lst) <- c("obj_factor", "obj_dataframe", "obj_matrix")

names(lst) # explore the list's names

lst$obj_dataframe # get access to the dataframe

```

::: callout-note
Time for a break!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------
